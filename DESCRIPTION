Description: Build powerful, linked-view dashboards in 'shiny' applications. With a 
    declarative, one-line setup, you can create bidirectional links between 
    interactive components. When a user interacts with one element (e.g., clicking 
    a map marker), all linked components (such as 'DT' tables or other charts) 
    instantly update. Supports 'leaflet' maps, 'DT' tables, 'plotly' charts, and spatial data 
    via 'sf' objects out-of-the-box, with an extensible API for custom components.
